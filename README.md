# Polynomial Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook template for performing polynomial regression, which allows for capturing non-linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. The notebook provides a comprehensive guide on training and visualizing both linear and polynomial regression models using a dataset of position levels and salaries.

## Notebook
